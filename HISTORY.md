History
=======

Patch releases mean (the Z number in X.Y.Z version) that the underlying physics has not changed.  Changes to the NEST version will always trigger a minor or major release.  If this library changes such that end users have to change their code, this may also trigger a minor or major release.

1.4.11 (2021-08-09)
-----------------
Sync with [NEST v2.2.3](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest/releases/tag/v2.2.3)

  * Replaced useTiming variable by an enum and made the GetS1 result a class member. Separated the S1 and S2 calculation modes.
  * Made GetS1 return a ref to avoid vector copy, while also adding gcem support and constexpr to offload some redundant operations
  * Made the GetS2 results a private member returned by reference, while also making GetS1 and GetS2 results "const"
  * Removed useless, unused variables that caused a lot of memory allocation/deallocation; result of all this and the above: +~1-5% faster
  * Updated the parametric S1 calc to account for the truncated-Gaussian SPE and DPE distributions, making it more consistent with "full"
  * Changed hybrid-mode transition to be 100 keV, ~500 photon hits in modern TPCs, instead of hits directly, creating a smooth transition
  * Efficiency adjustment in the S1 parametric mode that further makes the parametric and full modes (previously useTiming -1,0) closer.
  * Changes driven by Quentin Riffard (LZ/LBNL) & Greg Rischbieter (LZ/UA), with ideas from Matthew (UA) & Luke Kreczko (Bristol)

1.4.10 (2021-07-08)
-----------------
Sync with [NEST v2.2.2](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest/releases/tag/v2.2.2)

Code Quality and/or Misc Bug Fixes:
  * Added default density argument for LXe case, forcing an argument re-ordering (Sophia)
  * Moved position of "delete detector" in execNEST to solve python problem (Albert Baker, Greg R.)
  * Approx eff func for single phe made simpler, for FlameDisx (Robert James, Sophia, Matthew)
  * More robust rule used for when to approximate binomial as Gaussian (Sophia, Greg R.)
  * Warn that you are in a region of too-low time between S1a and S1b for Kr83m only 1x (Sophia)
  * Bad-order if-statements simplified with a min within a max for <0, >1 checks (Luke K., Matthew)
New Physics:
  * Liquid Ar model for ER fits all the data better now, in both energy and dE/dx bases (Kate K.)

Code Quality and/or Miscellaneous Bug Fixes:
  * Deleted unused redundant line in GetS1 that re-calculated the drift time (Quentin Riffard, LBNL/LZ)
  * Only print most error and warning messages if verbosity on (Quentin Riffard, LBNL/LZ)
  * Updated TravisCI link in README and added note about OSX builds (Chris Tunnell, Rice/XENON)
  * Use of abs value func standardized, lines broken up, multi-line string for cerr (Matthew at behest of Luke Kreczko, Bristol/LZ)
New Physics:
  * Liquid Xe model for NR is now better behaved at few hundred keV and few hundred in S1: no odd increase in band width caused by Nex/Ni zeroing out and kinking the recombination probability. Mean yields model unchanged, nor recombination fluctuations / skewness. (Matthew and Greg R., UAlbany/LZ)

1.4.9 (2021-06-01)
-----------------
Sync with [NEST v2.2.1patch2](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest/releases/tag/v2.2.1patch2)

1.4.8 (2021-04-09)
-----------------
Sync with [NEST v2.2.1patch1](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest/releases/tag/v2.2.1patch1)

1.4.7 (2021-03-03)
-----------------
Sync with [NEST v2.2.1](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest/releases/tag/v2.2.1)
  * Cleaned up MANIFEST so pypi dist packages are less bulky
    [#56](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nestpy/pull/56)
  * Added floating point comparison method for equality checks
    [#54](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nestpy/pull/54)
  * Random Number Generation in bindings.cpp to ensure quanta are truly randomized.
    [#54](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nestpy/pull/54)
  * Binding to Kr83m yields model directly so users can specify explicity deltaT_ns between decay modes.
